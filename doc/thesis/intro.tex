\section{Introduction}

Remote Direct Memory Access (RMDA) is a powerful communication mechanism that offers the potential for exceptional performance.
RDMA allows one machine to directly access the memory of a remote machine across the network without the interaction of the 
remote CPU. This gives developers a plethora of options to implement communication protocols. However, using these options 
effectively is not trivial and the observed performance can vary greatly for seemingly minor differences. 

Existing research either primarily focuses on evaluating very low level verb performance~\cite{anuj-guide} or focuses
strongly on 
Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)~\cite{eval-mpp} often comparing the observed performance to using remote data 
structures~\cite{fasst, rpc-vs-rdma}. Nearly all of them employ naive message passing protocols using either 
send receive or RDMA writes with ring-buffers~\cite{rdma-fast-dbms} or \emph{mailboxes}~\cite{ziegler2020rdma} and do not 
take full advantage of 
features offered by modern RDMA-capable network controllers. Further, hardly any work looks into the usage of shared receive
queues, memory fences, or atomics for resource sharing.

\paragraph{}In this thesis we implement and evaluate various different message passing protocols. We show that there are a 
many ways to implement data exchange connections using less used RDMA features such as \emph{shared receive queues}, \emph{reads}, 
\emph{memory fences}, and \emph{RDMA atomics}. We also show that even common approaches such as ring-buffer based protocols 
can be implemented in multiple ways, giving us different performance characteristics and features.

\begin{itemize}
  \item We focus on implementing message passing protocols, without limiting us to RPCs. We believe this gives engineers 
    building blocks to develop more sophisticated protocols without micro-benchmarking basic verbs.
  \item We define connection features outside of raw performance which have been relevant for applications, such as 
    efficient resource usage.
  \item We implement and evaluate different message passing protocols. We reason why we explicitly implemented these protocols
    and evaluate them for different communication patterns.
  \item We provide a performance model to better understand the observed performance.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}We think that this work, with 
implementations of more unusual communication protocols, inspires system designers to develop 
new protocols that make more extensive use of modern RNICs.
